I created this repository based on the course <b>GitHub Actions - The Complete Guide </b> by Maximilian Schwarzmuller, available at Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/course/github-actions-the-complete-guide/ 

The main focus of this course is to learn bout CI / CD and deployment using GHActions. Therefore, even if the UI is developed in React,
it is very simple since it is not the focus of this course and therefore this specific repository. 

You can see the page deployed here in AWS: http://gh-actions-open-id-security.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/
